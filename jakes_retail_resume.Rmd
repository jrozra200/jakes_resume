# Summary

\btwocol
I am a multifaceted professional who excels at leading teams, fixing problems, 
building products, creating and maintaining relationships, and helping customers 
through excellent service. I am curious and constantly learning and improving. 

I love to investigate the status quo - always looking to see if there are better 
ways to solve challenges. I am also a technophile, interested in enhancing our 
world with more and more sophisticated techologies.
