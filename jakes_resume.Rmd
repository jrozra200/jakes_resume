# Summary

\btwocol
I love to learn in general, but mostly I am a data fanatic - I love reading, writing, and learning about all things data: science, analysis, and visualizations. I turn data of all kinds into insight. 

\begin{center}

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
venn.plot <- draw.triple.venn(
        area1 = 65,
        area2 = 75,
        area3 = 85,
        n12 = 35,
        n23 = 15,
        n13 = 25,
        n123 = 5,
        category = c("Data Skills", "Statistics", "Business Accumen"),
        fill = c("#1d6ae5", "#b3c5e0", "#19396b"),
        cat.cex = 1.5,
        cat.col = c("#1d6ae5", "#b3c5e0", "#19396b"),
        cex = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
)
